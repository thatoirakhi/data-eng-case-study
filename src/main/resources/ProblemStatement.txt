### Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to analyze taxi trip data to derive insights and implement solutions for optimizing taxi operations. The project involves the following key objectives:

1. **Data Transformation and Aggregation**:
   - Enrich raw taxi trip data by joining it with zone lookup data.
   - Perform transformations to extract time-based features (e.g., pickup hour) and calculate trip-specific metrics (e.g., trip duration).

2. **High-Demand Zone Identification**:
   - Aggregate data to identify zones and time intervals with high demand.
   - Rank zones by demand to prioritize areas for operational focus.

3. **Shared Ride Feasibility**:
   - Determine zones and time intervals where shared rides can be promoted by analyzing passenger counts and trip overlaps.
   - Mark zones as feasible for shared rides based on predefined thresholds.

4. **Dynamic Pricing Model**:
   - Implement a dynamic pricing model that adjusts fare prices based on demand metrics (e.g., total trips).

5. **Final Price Calculation**:
   - Calculate the final price for trips by combining dynamic pricing adjustments with shared ride feasibility discounts.

6. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Write unit tests to validate the correctness of data transformations, aggregations, shared ride feasibility logic, and dynamic pricing calculations.
